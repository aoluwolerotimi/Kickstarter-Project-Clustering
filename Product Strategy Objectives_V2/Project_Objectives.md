## Grounding in Product Strategy 
### How this project fits into the product context
Kickstarter's mission is to help bring creative projects to life. As a Public Benefit Corporation, they are also committed to generating positive outcomes for society as much as their shareholders. 

Providing a marketplace platform connecting creators and backers, Kickstarter is in the game of transactions. The revenue model hinges on the 5% fee earned on successfully funded projects. Kickstarter's all-or-nothing funding model drives confidence and accountability for both creators and backers.  No funds are collected and no money is exchanged until the project reaches its goal in the specifed campaign timeframe. Backers can pledge with confidence that, if funds are collected, the version of the project they believed in will reveive the budget it needs. Similarly, creators accountability to the project will be paired with adequate funding to achieve it. This model also means that the point of revenue generation for Kickstarter is when a project is successfully funded.

The platfrom is a marketplace product which is in the game of transactions, while also preserving a strong commitment to their values of benefiting society as a Public Benefit Corporation.
