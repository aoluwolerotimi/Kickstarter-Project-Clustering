## Project Objectives
### The objectives of this project for the product team is to
* Enrich understanding of Kickstarter's portfolio of projects

* Identify patterns in the types of projects driving revenue

* Identify what net new learnings, if any, from revenue driving projects can help underperforming projects? 

* If such learnings are identified, where can the product team apply them first?
 
## Grounding in Product Strategy 
### How this project fits into the product context
Kickstarter's mission is to help bring creative projects to life. As a Public Benefit Corporation, they are also committed to generating positive outcomes for society as much as their shareholders. 

Providing a marketplace platform connecting creators and backers, Kickstarter is in the game of transactions. The revenue model hinges on the 5% fee earned on successfully funded projects. Kickstarter's all-or-nothing funding model drives confidence and accountability for both creators and backers.  No funds are collected and no money is exchanged until the project reaches its goal in the specifed campaign timeframe. Backers can pledge with confidence that, if funds are collected, the version of the project they believed in will reveive the budget it needs. Similarly, creators accountability to the project will be paired with adequate funding to achieve it. This model also means that the point of revenue generation for Kickstarter is when a project is successfully funded.

### The North Star Metric
The three key characteristics of an effective North Star metric are as follows  
* Measures customer value

* Aligns with product vision

* Leading indicator of revenue (but is not revenue itself)

For Kickstarter, an effective North Star Metric would be number of fulfilled campaigns. A fulfilled campaign is one that is fully funded and which has fulfilled its reward promises to backers. This measures customer value as what creators "buy" from the platform is an avenue to bring their projects to life while what backers buy is the opportunity to be a patron of that project - becoming part of the realization story receiving a token of appreciation in the form of a reward. It aligns with the product vision of bringing creative projects to life because each uptick in this metric involves a funded project which is complete enough to issue rewards. Measuring by number of projects rather than value also aligns with the platform mission to empower a broad variety of creatives to bring their projects to life. This is implictly captured in the frequency aspect of the metric. Finally, it is a leading indicator of revenue in multiple ways. In the most straightforward sense, more successfully funded projects means more revenue. But in terms of growth, retention, and lifetime value, funded projects would promote these for creators while completed projects with fulfilled rewards would these for backers.

The project should yield insights and results that promote the success of this metric through its input metrics.
